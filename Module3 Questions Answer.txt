Q)   What is CLI command In React Js?
	In React, the CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of creating and managing React applications. Let me provide you with some relevant information:

	Create React App (CRA):
	Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications.
	It offers a modern build setup with no configuration, making it easy for developers to get started.


	To create a new React app using CRA, follow these steps:
	Open your terminal or command prompt.

	Run the following command:
	npx create-react-app my-app
	This will create a new React project named “my-app.”

	Change into the project directory:
	cd my-app

	Start the development server:
	npm start

	Your app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/.

Q)   What is Components in React Js?

	React components are like building blocks for creating user interfaces in React.js. They serve a similar purpose as JavaScript functions but work in isolation and return HTML elements. 

	Let’s dive into the details:
	
    1) Function Components:

    These are the most common type of React components.
    Created using a function.
    Return HTML elements.
    Easier to understand and preferred in modern React development.

    Example of a function component called Car:
    function Car() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
    }

    2) Class Components (used less frequently now):

    Created using a class that extends React.Component.
    Have access to lifecycle methods.

    Example of a class component called Car:
    class Car extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
      }
    }

    3) Rendering a Component:

    Once you’ve defined a component, you can use it in your application.
    To render the Car component, use similar syntax as normal HTML:

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(<Car />);

    4) Props:

    Components can receive data through props (short for properties).
    Props are like function arguments and are passed into the component as attributes.

    Example of a Car component that accepts a color prop:
    function Car(props) {
      return <h2>I am a {props.color} Car!</h2>;
    }

    5) Components in Components:
    
    You can nest components inside other components.

    Example using the Car component inside a Garage component:
    function Garage() {
      return (
        <>
          <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1>
          <Car />
        </>
      );
    }

Q)   What is Header and Content Components in React Js? 

    In React, components are the building blocks of web applications. They encapsulate specific functionality and user interface elements. Let’s delve into the concepts of Header and Content components:

    1) Header Component:
    The Header component typically appears at the top of a web page or application. It provides essential navigation elements, branding, and other relevant information.
    
    Here are some key points about the Header component:
    
    * It often includes elements like the site logo, navigation links, search bars, and user profile information.
    * In a React project, you would create a separate file for the Header component (e.g., Header.js).
    * The Header component can be reused across different pages or views within your application.
    * Example components that might be part of the Header:
    * Logo: Displays the site logo or brand name.
    * NavBar: Contains navigation links to different sections of the site.
    * User Profile: Shows user-related information or login/logout options.

    2) Content Component:
    The Content component represents the main area of your web page or application. It displays the actual content, such as articles, images, forms, or any other user-specific data.
    
    Here are some details about the Content component:

    * It varies based on the specific use case of your application.
    * In a React project, you would define a separate file for the Content component (e.g., Content.js).
    * The Content component can be dynamic and change based on user interactions or data fetched from APIs.
    * Example components that might be part of the Content:
    * Article: Displays blog posts, news articles, or other textual content.
    * Image Gallery: Shows a collection of images.
    * Form: Allows users to input data or perform actions.
    * Product Listings: Displays items for sale in an e-commerce app.

Q)  How to install React Js on Windows, linux Operating System?

    Installing React.js on Windows:

    1) Install Node.js:
    First, download and install the LTS version of Node.js for Windows. You can find the installer here.
    During installation, follow the default settings and click “Next” until it’s completely installed.
    To verify the installation, open a command prompt and type:

    node -v

    If it displays the Node.js version (e.g., v14.15.3), the installation was successful.

    2) Install Create React App:

    In the terminal, run the following command to globally install Create React App:
    npm install -g create-react-app
    
    To verify the installation, run:
    create-react-app --version

    It should display the installed version (e.g., 4.0.3).

    3) Create a New React Project:

    Create a new folder where you want to set up your React app. For example:
    mkdir my-react-app
    
    Move into the newly created folder:
    cd my-react-app
    
    Initialize your React app using Create React App:
    create-react-app reactfirst

    4)  Start Your React App:

    Open your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and open the folder where you installed the React app.

    Use the terminal within your app’s folder:
    cd reactfirst
    
    To start your app, run:
    npm start
    
    A new tab will open in your browser, showing the React logo. Congratulations! You’ve successfully installed React and are ready to build awesome websites and apps.

    Installing React.js on Linux (Ubuntu):

    1) Install Node.js:
    Open a terminal and run:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nodejs
    sudo apt install npm
    
    Verify the installation:
    node -v

    2)Install Create React App:
    Run:
    sudo npm install -g create-react-app

    3) Create a New React Project:

    Create a folder for your project:

Q)   How to check version of React Js?

    1) Using package.json File:
    The package.json file contains metadata about your React project. By default, it’s created when you set up a React app.
    To find the React version, look under the list of dependencies in the package.json file.

    If you haven’t created a React app yet, you can do so using the following command:
    npx create-react-app your_app_name

    Once your app is set up, check the package.json file to see the React version.

    2) Using the Command Line:
    Open your command line or terminal.

    Run the following command to check the React version:
    npm view react version
    
    The output will display the installed React version.

    3) Using the Version Property of Default Import from React:
    In your JavaScript code, import React and access the version property from the default import.
    Example:
    JavaScript
    
    import React from 'react';
    
    const App = () => {
      return (
        <h1>
          We are currently using React version {React.version}
        </h1>
      );
    };
    
    export default App;
